# TodoList

Developed a user-friendly Todo List application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, github, and vs Code. The app allows users to efficiently manage tasks, track progress, edit entries, saving usernames, and deleting tasks. Implemented features such as crossing off tasks, saving to local storage to save list, and the ability to change order of the list by data. 
In the future I hope to add a dark mode feature and the ability to email lists.
